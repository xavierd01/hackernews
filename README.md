MVC Core displaying data from Hacker News API.

Development challenge: 
Use https://github.com/HackerNews/API to generate a page using C# and .NET that displays the title and author of the current best stories on Hacker News.

<ul>
<li>As a User, I would like to see a list of the best stories on Hacker News.</li>
<li>As a User, I would like the ability to search best stories by title.</li>
<li>As a User, I would like the ability to search best stories by author.</li>
<li>As a User, I would like viewing and searching of best stories to be responsive. I should not have to wait more than a couple seconds for the page to load.</li>
</ul>

<p>Used dotnet cli (dotnet new mvc) to generate MVC Core template. C#/.NET/Razor</p>

<p>Used In-Memory cache.
